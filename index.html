      <h3 class="fontFam">About Me</h3> 
      <p class="fontFam fontSize">
       I love surfing the web and looking at different websites, I always was interested how each website was created. I see web development as art form. I love coding and seeing immediate visuals from code.
       I love working in teams since I was a young kid playing basketball with multiple teams. I think collaboration is important for success in anything.
